# GenshinBuilds

## About the Project

The application, GenshinBuilds, is a forum application focused on documenting and sharing various character builds from the game, Genshin Impact. GenshinBuilds allows travelers to sign up and log in to be able to participate in sharing specific character builds they would like to showcase to the community. When a user logs in, they would immediately see builds shared by other travelers to the community. The user has an option to contribute to the community by sharing his/her own build. They can also view their own builds on their profile and have an option to edit their profile. This app was made as a final project output for the course MOBDEVE - Mobile Application Development.
